# CommuniTii

### What is CommuniTii?
#### The Problem

- As New Yorkers, we find ourselves increasingly isolated by the use of conventional social media platforms. 

- Social media has taken the social aspect out of the equation.

- Our privacy is constantly put at risk.

#### The Solution

- A stable and flexible platform that encourages people to socialize in-person

- Gamification (e.g. - Using badges as incentives)

- Use existing infrastructure to leverage social engagement (e.g. - non-profits)

- Implementing privacy safeguards (e.g. - Using QR codes)
